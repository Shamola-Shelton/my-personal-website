        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there! My name is <strong>Shelton Shamola</strong>, and I was born on December 28th, 1998. I'm a proud Kenyan, a passionate learner, and someone who thrives on creativity, logic, and curiosity. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in <strong>Business Information Technology</strong>, and my journey has been one of discovery, growth, and a pursuit of purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a mix of introvert and extrovert — I cherish quiet moments indoors coding for hours, but I also enjoy occasional adventures, laughter with friends, and creating memories with those I love. I'm deeply grounded in my Christian faith, which serves as my moral compass and gives direction to my life and goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Music is a huge part of my identity. It’s my sanctuary. My playlists are dominated by lyrical genius — <strong>J. Cole</strong>, <strong>Drake</strong>, <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong>, and the soulful melodies of <strong>Rihanna</strong> and <strong>James Arthur</strong>. These artists have shaped my moods, sparked my ideas, and helped me feel understood.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also bleed red — not just in biology, but in football. <strong>Manchester United</strong> is my team, and I’ve supported them through thick and thin. Football reminds me of life — it's unpredictable, emotional, and full of passion.
        </p>

        <p>
          But above all, I love coding. There’s something magical about turning a blank screen into something functional and beautiful. Programming gives me the ability to solve problems, build useful things, and express creativity in a logical way. I'm especially interested in web development — bringing ideas to life on the internet, one line of code at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spend most of my days in front of a computer, either coding, reading documentation, watching tutorials, or debugging. But life isn’t all semicolons and divs — I have a soft side. I’m currently in a relationship with an amazing woman named <strong>Graca Tae</strong>. She’s supportive, kind, and brings joy into my world. We share laughs, dreams, and a vision of growing together.
        </p>

        <p>
          My ambition is to become a world-class software developer. I believe in continuous learning, consistency, and building meaningful projects. This website is just the beginning of that journey. If you’re here to learn about me, collaborate, or just browse — welcome, and thank you.
