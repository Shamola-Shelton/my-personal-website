        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am <strong>Shelton Shamola</strong>, a 26-year-old technology enthusiast from Kenya, born on December 28, 1998. Guided by my Christian faith, I am committed to pursuing purpose, fostering creativity, and advancing my skills in software development. Standing at 5’9” and holding a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Business Information Technology</strong>, I combine analytical rigor with creative problem-solving to develop meaningful digital solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in the Moringa School Bootcamp, an intensive program that is enhancing my proficiency in software development. My journey began with mastering the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, creating structured and visually appealing web pages. I have since progressed to JavaScript, exploring its capabilities to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. I actively utilize resources such as freeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow to deepen my knowledge, addressing challenges and celebrating milestones as I work toward becoming a skilled software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music plays a significant role in my life, providing inspiration during my studies. Artists such as <strong>J. Cole</strong> and <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> offer profound lyrical content that encourages critical thinking, while <strong>Drake</strong> and <strong>Rihanna</strong> provide motivational energy. The emotive music of <strong>James Arthur</strong> helps me maintain focus and emotional balance during complex coding tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an avid follower of football and a dedicated supporter of <strong>Manchester United</strong>. The sport has taught me the importance of strategy, teamwork, and resilience—principles I apply to my professional and personal endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          My commitment to growth drives me to code daily, learn from setbacks, and refine my skills through practical projects. This website serves as a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and professional development in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technology, I enjoy quality time with my girlfriend, <strong>Graca Tae</strong>, whose support and encouragement are invaluable. Additionally, I am an enthusiast of the television series <strong>Game of Thrones,</strong>, which captivates me with its intricate storytelling and complex characters, offering a welcome respite from my technical pursuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my website. I invite you to explore my projects and connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities in web development.
